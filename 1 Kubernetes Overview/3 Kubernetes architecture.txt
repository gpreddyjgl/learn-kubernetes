Kubernetes Architecture:
========================

* Node:

	* Machine (Physical or Virtual) where Kubernetes is installed.
	
Cluster:
=========

	* collection of nodes grouped together
	
Master:
========

	* Manages the Cluster
	* Node with kubernetes installed in it.
	

Components:
============

	* API Server - Frontend for Kubernetes
	* etcd - K:V store
	* kubelet - agent that runs in each node in the cluster
	* Container Runtime - underlying software to run container
	* Controller - Brain behind Orchestration
	* Scheduler - distrbuting work across multiple nodes
	
Master vs Worker Nodes:
========================

* Worker - Containers are hosted (Node or Minion)
* API Server - Kubelet
* data is stored in etcd K:V store in master



Kubectl:
========

kubectl run hello-minikube

kubectl cluster-info

kubectl get nodes
